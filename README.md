# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose for this project is to provide a client with a set of code modules that they can use to run analysis of stock data at the click of a button. The client requested that they don't need access to the modules, so the use of buttons was implemented on to the worksheet of excel. 
We were given a starting point of skeleton code and had to complete the code.

## Results

The result of the analysis can show that investing in 2017 would lead to lose, while investing in 2018 could lead to a beter investment if 2019 stocks rise in price. This conclusion can be made via the images shown below, where there is more percentage loss (red) than there is percentage gain (green) in 2018 compared to 2017, meaning any investments made in 2017 would lead to loss.

## Summary

> What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

An advantage to refactoring code is not having to start with a blank page and stating from nothing. The disadvatages of refaction code is sometimes glancing over where code may have been copied incorrectly. 

> How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

For example, in two of the for loops I put a minus sign in both instead of a minus in one and a plus in the other. This lead to my code not running correctly. I've highlighted below the for loops in question and where I had missed the plus and minus.
